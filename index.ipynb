    "I often find myself coding a machine learning experiment in a Jupyter Notebook, using [wandb](https://www.wandb.com/) to visualize and track the results of the runs. When the experiment is drafted, I always have questions such as: How will the performance be affected by the parameter `a`? What if I change the number of items of the dataset, or change the dataset completely?\n",

    "[wandb sweeps](https://docs.wandb.com/sweeps) are a great tool to solve these questions. However, sweeping requires that you define a specific training function for the sweep, which I find redundant, specially when the code for training is already in the Jupyter Notebook. Furthermore, if I make some changes in the original notebook, I have to be sure that I change the sweep function too.\n",
